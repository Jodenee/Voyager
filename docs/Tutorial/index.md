In these tutorials you'll learn the [*basics of Voyager*](getting-started.md), [*error handling*](error-handling.md) and how to [*protect remote events from exploiters*](securing-remotes.md). You are required to know the basics of [*luau*](https://luau-lang.org/). It is recommended that you know some basic [*OOP*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts as well but it's not needed. It is also recommended that you do not skim through them, this is to ensure you don't miss anything important.

Also keep in mind that these tutorials dont go over absolutely everything! If you wanna make the most of Voyager it is critical to read the documintation as it will cover everything Voyager has to offer.

If at any point you start struggling trying to understand something, you can use the documentation for a more in depth explanation. If that still does not suffice you can message [*me*](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/jodenewastaken/summary) on the devforum!
