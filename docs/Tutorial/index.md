In this tutorial you will learn how to use Voyager. You are required to know the basics of [*luau*](https://luau-lang.org/). It is recommended that you know some basic [*OOP*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts as well but it's not needed. It is also recommended that you read through the entire page instead of skimming through it, this is to ensure you don't miss anything important.

If at any point you start struggling trying to understand something, message [*me*](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/jodenewastaken/summary) on the devforum! 

???+ warning
    Please only do this as the last resort, and if you do send me a message, include as much information as you can. And lastly do not ask me to code you a solution, as I will promptly ghost you.
