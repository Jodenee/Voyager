## **About**

Voyager is a Roblox API wrapper for Discord webhooks. Voyager makes interacting with Discord webhooks much easier, as you not only write less code but the code you do write is much more readable too, this results in a much better developer experience. Voyager also has very good API coverage over Discord's webhook API, so no matter how niche your use case is, Voyager can most likely help you out!

## **Key Features**

- **Simple:** Voyager is curated to be easily utilized by both beginner and advanced scripters.
- **Flexible:** Voyager is curated to be modular as to fit as many use cases as possible.
- **Pre-request data validation:** Voyager comes with built in validation functions that automatically validate any data you give it before making an HTTP request. This is done to mitigate making pointless requests to the proxy, as making too many bad requests may get you temporarily or indefinitely banned from the proxy.
